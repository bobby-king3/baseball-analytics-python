A learning project translating baseball analytics concepts from **"Analyzing Baseball Data with R"** by Max Marchi and Jim Albert into Python.

## About

This repository contains Python implementations of statistical analyses and visualizations from the book "Analyzing Baseball Data with R". While the original book uses R and ggplot2, this project recreates the analyses using Python's data science stack (pandas, matplotlib, seaborn, scikit-learn).

- **Book:** [Analyzing Baseball Data with R](https://a.co/d/7Mjuz71) by Max Marchi, Jim Albert, and Benjamin S. Baumer
- **Original R Code:** [Baseball R Repository](https://github.com/beanumber/baseball_R)
- **Website:** [Baseball With R](https://baseballwithr.wordpress.com/)

This is an independent learning project. All Python code is original, though analysis methodologies follow the book.
