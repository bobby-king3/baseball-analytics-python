# Baseball Analytics in Python

Translating baseball analytics concepts from "Analyzing Baseball Data with R" to Python.

## About

This repository contains Python implementations of statistical analyses from the book "Analyzing Baseball Data with R", translated into Python's data science stack (pandas, matplotlib, seaborn, scikit-learn).

**Chapters covered:** Starting from Chapter 4 (Chapters 1-3 focuses on R installation and basics)  
**Data:** Extended through 2024 season (book uses data through 2022) so some metrics will slightly differ from the book

## Notebooks

- [04 - The Relation Between Runs and Wins](notebooks/04_runs_and_wins.ipynb) - Linear regression, Pythagorean expectation
- [05 - Value of Plays Using Run Expectancy](notebooks/05_run_expectancy.ipynb) - Run expectancy matrices, base-out states
